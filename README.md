# Mini Microsoft Office Paint Done in C++
This is a little C++ program I wrote in a class in college. Run <pre>make</pre> from the command line then run the program: <pre>./graphics1</pre>

If you're familiar with GLU and glut then you're ahead of the game but if not, the code is pretty straight forward.

## How to use

Once you've got it running you can select a color by using the dials at the top left and draw either a circle, rectangle, or triangle by first selecting the corresponding button then clicking on the screen. Don't click and drag; click three time for a triangle, twice for a circle and twice for a rectangle.
